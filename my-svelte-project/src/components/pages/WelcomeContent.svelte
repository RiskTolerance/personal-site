		<h2>I'm glad you're here!</h2>
		<p>
			A few years ago I built cookie-cutter site on a whim and found that
			having a place to post my work and ideas was a great way to stay
			motivated and look back on what I had accomplished.
			<br />
			<br />
			But my generic website was also a source of distress. I wanted to have
			a site that reflected my creative ability and my desire to grow and improve.
			So, after spending most of 2020 jamming my poor designer brain full of
			JavaScript, I'm pretty sure I have achieved at least some of the ideas
			that have been bouncing around in my head.
			<br />
			<br />
			I hope that you enjoy!
			<br />
