            A few years ago I built cookie-cutter site on a whim and found that having a place to post my work and ideas was a great way to stay motivated and look back on what I had accomplished. <br><br>
            But my generic website was also a source of distress. I wanted to have a site that reflected my creative ability and my desire to grow and improve. So, after spending most of 2020 jamming my poor designer brain full of JavaScript, I'm pretty sure I can achieve at least some of the ideas that have been bouncing around in my head. <br><br>
            I hope you enjoy! <br><br>
